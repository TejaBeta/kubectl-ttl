# kubectl-ttl ![Build](https://github.com/TejaBeta/kubectl-ttl/workflows/Go/badge.svg) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

A kubectl plugin to add `time-to-live` option to Kubernetes resources.

## Story time (Why?)

The story behind the creation of this tool is quite straight forward, we just required a tool to somehow kill/clean resources after certain point of time. 

To facilitate the above mentioned process, `kubectl-ttl` came into existence just to help myself and others in the K8s community to use the tool and make life easier. 

## How?

Nothing complex, based on the command parameters the tool creates a **`job`** within the namespace with the appropriate role to delete the given resources at a particular time within the namespace.

## Usage

```

#Default ttl of 15mins for a particular resource
kubectl get deployments -o yaml | kubectl ttl

#Custom ttl for 10mins for a particular resource
kubectl get pods -o yaml | kubectl ttl -t 10

```
